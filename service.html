What methods do I use?
In my therapeutic practice I use multiple methods, often in combination, as is appropriate to suit the needs of the
individual’s situation. I have a preference for EMDR due to its efficiency and prompt outcomes, especially with trauma
related issues. However, I have a wide range of training in other modes.

Mediation.

Mindfulness
I encourage all my clients to engage in some Mindfulness practice. It can change how we think, and feel, and live, and
can enhance everyday awareness to help us stop doing the same old thing repeatedly and ending up in the same miserable
space. Mindfulness is a mental state, characterised by concentrated awareness of one’s thoughts, actions, or
motivations. I like Jon Kabat-Zinn’s definition of Mindfulness which states: “Mindfulness is paying attention; on
purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally.”

I have used Mindfulness for many years and believe it has helped me immensely in terms of reflective self awareness
without giving in to inner reactivity.

Utilising Mindfulness can be helpful when it comes to changing patterns in substance abuse, coping with cravings and
impulses, and becoming more mind and body aware during trauma therapy. EMDR incorporates a little of Mindfulness too in
that you are prompted to ‘just notice’ or asked “what came up?”
